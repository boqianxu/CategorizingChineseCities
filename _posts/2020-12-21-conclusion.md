**Results**

- China's cities could be divided into six categories based on Ecosystem Service Value and Amenity Value.
- However, more than 75% cities are in Category-1 with low ESV and Amenity Value.
- Most of the Category-1 cities are located in mid- and west-China, which challenges the perception that the regions are amenity poor but ecologically rich.
- Most of the Category-0 cities are located along Yangtze River Delta with high ESV.
- All the four category-3 cities are the first-tier metropolises (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen) of high Amenity Value and moderate ESV.
